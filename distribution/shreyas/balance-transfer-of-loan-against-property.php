          <p>Your property builds value both emotionally and economically with time. <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against Property</a> you can leverage the economic worth of your property while continuing to enjoy occupancy of the same, so that you get immediate finance to meet a variety of personal and business needs.

          <p>The term <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against property</a> refers to a situation in which the borrower takes a loan from a bank or financial institution where the security for the loan is a property that is owned by the borrower. If you own a valuable asset in the form of house (self occupied, rented or vacant) or a commercial property you can go for a <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan against property</a> is a multi-purpose loan with longer tenure and lesser rate of interest.

          <p>Balance Transfer of <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against property</a> refers to transferring of existing loan to a new lender for better rate and additional loan amount. Balance transfer of <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against Property</a> happens when the entire unpaid principal loan amount is transferred to another bank for a lower rate of interest. The bank that had originally extended the loan to you gets the unpaid amount and you have to, in turn, now pay your EMIs at the new rate to the bank that has taken up the loan. Almost every bank in the country has a facility for a balance transfer of <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against Property</a> and if you have been paying your EMIs regularly, there is often no problem associated with it.</p>
          
          <p>There is, however, a considerable amount of work involved for balance transfer of <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against Property</a> The bank where your loan will be transferred will do a credit background check and if they are not satisfied with your credit worthiness, there is every chance of your balance transfer of <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" class="text-link">Loan Against Property</a> being refused</p>
