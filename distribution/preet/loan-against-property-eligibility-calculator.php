The loan is given as a certain percentage of the property's market value, which may differ bank to bank. Loan Against Property belongs to the secured loan category where the borrower gives a guarantee by using his property as security. You can use your house as collateral to take a loan from a bank. The latter will exercise due diligence as far as the property is concerned, appraise its value, and offer you certain percentage of its value as loan.</p>
