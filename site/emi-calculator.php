    	<h2>EMI<strong> Calculator</strong></h2>
        <p>Equated Monthly Installment – EMI for short – is the amount payable every month to the bank or any other financial institution until the loan amount is fully paid off. It consists of the interest on loan as well as part of the principal amount to be repaid. The sum of principal amount and interest is divided by the tenure, i.e., number of months, in which the loan has to be repaid. This amount has to be paid monthly. The interest component of the EMI would be larger during the initial months and gradually reduce with each payment. The exact percentage allocated towards payment of the principal depends on the interest rate. Even though your  monthly  EMI payment won't change, the proportion of principal and interest components will change with time. With each successive payment, you'll pay more towards the principal and less in interest.</p><br>
        <p>In EMI calculator you will be able to analysis the total output of interest you will be paying. In this mechanism you will be able to know the total EMI paid and the interest payable. In EMI  Calculator you can also come to know how much interest you will be paying throughout the tenure. To work effectively on EMI Calculator you must be aware of the Loan Amount and the rate of interest. In EMI calculator you will come to know the total  interest paid at the end of the Loan tenure.</p><br>
