        <div class="content">
        Yes! NRIs can definitely appoint a Power of Attorney to complete all loan formalities towards the purchase of a property in India, considering the fact that an NRI wouldn't be in India for long periods.

        <p>&bull; The execution of the power of attorney must be done on a stamp paper or plain paper, as the case may be in the country where the power of attorney is being executed.</p>
        <p>&bull; The signatures of the executants have to be attested by an official of the Indian Embassy, Indian Consulate or Trade Commissioner, in the country where the executants reside.</p>
        <p>&bull; The signature of the attorney should be verified in India by a Notary, his employer or his banker on a separate piece of paper which should be submitted to Banks / NBFC's together with the Power of Attorney.</p>
