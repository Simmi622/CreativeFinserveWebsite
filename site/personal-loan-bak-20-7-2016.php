            <h1>Unsecured Personal Loan Overview</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Unsecured Personal Loan is issued and supported only by the borrower's credit worthiness, rather than by a type of collateral. An Unsecured Personal Loan is one that is obtained without the use of property as collateral for the loan. Borrowers generally must have high credit ratings to be approved for an Unsecured Personal Loan.</p>
          <p>Because an Unsecured Personal Loan is not guaranteed by any type of property, these loans are bigger risks for lenders and, as such, typically have higher interest rates than secured loans (such as a <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" style="color:#06F;">mortgage</a>). Although the interest rates are higher, the rates may still be lower than those of credit cards. Unlike <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/loan-against-property.php" style="color:#06F;">mortgage loans</a>, the interest on an Unsecured Personal Loan is not tax deductible.</p>
          <p>An Unsecured Personal Loan may be a good option for individuals who do not have enough equity in their homes to be approved for a <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/home-loan.php" style="color:#06F;">home equity loan</a>. An Unsecured Personal Loan may have a fixed interest rate and be due at the end of a specified term, or it can exist as a revolving line of credit with a variable interest rate. You can use Unsecured Personal Loan as per your convenience without being monitored for the actual end usage.</p>

It consists of the interest on loan as well as part of the principal amount to be repaid. The sum of principal amount and interest is divided by the tenure, i.e., number of months, in which the loan has to be repaid. This amount has to be paid monthly. The interest component of the EMI would be larger during the initial months and gradually reduce with each payment. The exact percentage allocated towards payment of the principal depends on the interest rate. Even though your  monthly  EMI payment won't change, the proportion of principal and interest components will change with time. With each successive payment, you'll pay more towards the principal and less in interest.</p>
