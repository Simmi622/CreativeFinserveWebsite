            <h2>Smart Home Loan Overview</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Banks offers you the unique Smart Credit loan, where you decide what interest you pay. Smart Credit power packs your loan with transactional features that not only allow you to save on interest, but also help you repay your loan much faster. So, now you can make your every rupee work as hard as you do. In Smart Credit account deposit your excess savings rather than keeping it idle. In Smart Credit you will have the flexibility to withdraw the surplus money deposited in Smart Credit account. Deposit your excess funds in Smart Credit and save the interest on your Loan. In Smart Credit interest is calculated on daily outstanding balance. In Smart Credit you can use this account like current account.</p>
          <p>To avail this product, you have to link a current or a savings account to your home loan at the same bank. You can deposit any surplus funds in this linked account. Whenever you deposit a surplus amount in the account, the bank considers this amount and deducts it from the principal of your home loan while calculating the interest on the outstanding <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/home-loan.php" class="text-link">home loan</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Smart <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/home-loan.php" class="text-link">home loan</a> helps borrowers in two ways. First, it reduces your interest outgo resulting in reduced EMI. In Smart <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/home-loan.php" class="text-link">Home Loan</a> your interest liability is lower and principal amount outgo is higher. In broader outlook customers not only save the tenure but also saves on interest.</p>
          
          <p>While smart <a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/home-loan.php" class="text-link">home loan</a></a> saves money, borrowers must evaluate the complete picture of the cost associated with it.</p>

           <p><a href="http://loaninmumbai.com/emi-calculator.php" class="text-link">Equated Monthly Installment</a> - EMI for short - is the amount payable every month to the bank or any other financial institution until the loan amount is fully paid off. It consists of the interest on loan as well as part of the principal amount to be repaid. The sum of principal amount and interest is divided by the tenure, i.e., number of months, in which the loan has to be repaid. This amount has to be paid monthly. The interest component of the EMI would be larger during the initial months and gradually reduce with each payment. The exact percentage allocated towards payment of the principal depends on the interest rate. Even though your  monthly  EMI payment won't change, the proportion of principal and interest components will change with time. With each successive payment, you'll pay more towards the principal and less in interest.</p>
